### A little about me

I am a self-taught  junior front end developer who develops myself in the field of front end technologies. Such as Html, Css, JavaScript and much more. I like to solve problems by using different tools and technologies. I attach great importance to open source and share my projects on github.  And I am also interested in mobile technologies. As a side project, I developed an application with react native.

Looking for an ambitious company which will challenge my developer and problem solving skills and allow me to continue to develop my knowledge and potential.
